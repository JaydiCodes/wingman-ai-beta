Make sure you **DID NOT** extract Wingman to `C:\Program Files` or another directory that needs admin priviledges. Pick a user directory like your Desktop, Documents, Downloads etc instead.

Extract all the files from the `.zip` file, not just the `.exe`.

If it still doesn't work, please join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/k8tTBar3gZ) and provide a screenshot showing the error message.

Please do not create a new GitHub issue for that.
