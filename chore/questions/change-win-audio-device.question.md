Here's how to set the default sound output for a particular program on Windows 10 (and probably 11):

- Right-click the speaker icon in the system tray:
- There should be a speaker icon in the lower-right corner of your screen. Right-click it.
  Open the sound settings.
- Select "Open sound settings" from the context menu. This will open the sound settings window.
  Scroll down to "Advanced sound options"
- In the sound settings window, scroll down to the "Advanced sound options" section.
  Select the output device for each application
- Under the App volume and device settings section, you should see a list of open applications and their corresponding output devices. Use the drop-down menus to select the output device you want for each application.
  Note that not all applications might appear in this list, depending on whether the application supports individual sound output settings.
